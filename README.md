# ASP.NET WEB APÄ°




APIs are essential tools in modern software development. They define the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with external software components, operating systems, libraries, or services. APIs are often used to enable the integration of third-party services, such as social media platforms, payment gateways, or cloud services, into an application. By using an API, developers can access the functionality of other software components without needing to understand their internal workings.

API is important for multi-platform developers. Platforms such as mobile, web, windows application send requests to the web server and in return receive data in json format and these data can be used everywhere in the project.

"http://localhost:your-port/api/User/Get"

this example sends a Get request to the api
